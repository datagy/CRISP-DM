Airbnb has been under a lot of scrutiny for its impacts on the local rental market, but it's also created an entirely new economy that has brought benefits to many in renting out spare bedrooms. In this post, we'll explore the Boston Airbnb Open Dataset available via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston). 

We'll look to answer five questions in particular:
1. How many units are sitting vacant throughout the year, potentially causing detrimental effects to the housing market in Boston?
2. How has the short-term rental economy grown, in terms of number of hosts?
3. How affordable is airbnb compared to a regular rental unit in various neighborhoods?
4. How many units exist away from the city center?
5. How affordable are units further away from the city center?

Let's dive right in!

## What are Airbnb's Vacancy Rates in Boston?
To get a better sense of whether or not Airbnb has a detrimental effect on the regular rental market, it can be helpful to look at the vacancy rates of comparable units.
