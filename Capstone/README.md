### Installation <a name="installation"></a>
All necessary packages can be installed with the Anaconda distribution.

### Introducing a Dataset <a name="dataset-introduction"></a>
This data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks.

Not all users receive the same offer, and that is the challenge to solve with this data set.

### Project Motivation <a name="project-motivation"></a>
In this project, I use the data to answer which features most influence the succesful completion of an offer, depending on the type of offer.

To answer the above 2 questions, I created 2 models for the data on  2 offer types provided. The two offers are: Buy One Get One Free (BOGO) and Discount (discount with purchase).

### File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
This repo includes the Jupyter notebook covering my analysis.

The main observations of the code are published [here](https://github.com/datagy/Udacity-Data-Science-Program/blob/master/Capstone/Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb).
